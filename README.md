## Development Process

My development process began figuring out how to configure Heroku with my project. After that was completed I went on to brainstorm quickly about what models I would need to write for the site. Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database. Once I had written out the models.py file, I went on the implement the different pages I would need.  
One by one, I would write a URL path in the urls.py file and then I would write the method in views.py which would render each of the specified paths. In those methods, the entire backend logic of the system is implemented.
