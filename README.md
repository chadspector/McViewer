# McViewer Documentation

## Here were gonna talk some smack

	In this project, I created my own version of a YouTube viewer using the Django framework with the help of the YouTube API. My application is called McViewer, representing the McGill chapter of TAMID. 
	Upon reaching the base homepage of McViewer on the web browser of their choice, the client is shown the McViewer logo, a brief description of what the app does, as well as a button to sign up. Should the user already have an account, the sidebar contains a sign in button for the user to sign in appropriately.
	The sign-up page prompts the user for the first name, last name, username of choice, email address, and password, each of which are required fields. If the user enters an email address without the “@” symbol, they are immediately shown a prompt that tells the user that the email address that they have entered is invalid. If the user attempts to create an account with an email or username that is already in use, a red error message appears and they are forced to choose another email/username. If all of the fields entered by the user are valid, the user is redirected to their McViewer dashboard.
	The sign-in page prompts the user for the email address and password associated to their McViewer account.
