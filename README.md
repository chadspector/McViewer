## Development Process

My development process began figuring out how to configure Heroku with my project. After that was completed I went on to brainstorm quickly about what models I would need to write for the site. Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database. Once I had written out the models.py file, I went on the implement the diffeent pages I would need.
